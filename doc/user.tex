\subsection{\texttt{mbg-infer}%
}
%
\begin{quote}{\ttfamily \raggedright \noindent
mbg-infer~module~database-file~input~{[}options{]}
}
\end{quote}

Produces the requested database file. Also produces plots of the dynamic traces of all
scalar parameters as PDF's, and saves them in the folder \texttt{name-plots}, where \texttt{name}
is the name of the database file. You will need to inspect these plots to determine how
many 'burnin' iterations should be discarded when making maps.

If you determine that more MCMC samples are needed, simply run mbg-infer with the same
database file argument to pick up where you left off and keep sampling.

\item The name of the module containing the model specification.

\item The name of the database file to be produced. If you do not want it to go in the current
directory, specify a path, eg \texttt{/home/anand/traces/run-01-04-2009}. If the database file
already exists, you will be prompted about whether you want to continue sampling into it
or remove it.

\item The name of a csv file containing the input data. If it is a different directory, specify
the path to it, eg \texttt{/home/anand/data/query-01-04-2009.csv}. This csv file must have the

\begin{itemize}

\item \texttt{lon}, \texttt{lat} : The coordinates of the observation in decimal degrees

\item \texttt{t} : Time in decimal years. This is only required for spatiotemporal models.

\end{itemize}

All other columns are interpreted as covariates, eg \texttt{ndvi} etc., UNLESS the module
implements the \texttt{non\_cov\_columns} attribute. See the PDF documentation.

\subsubsection{Options%
}
%
\begin{itemize}

\item \texttt{-n} or \texttt{-{}-n-bins} : The number of bins to use in the histogram from which quantiles
are computed. Large values are good, but use up more system memory. Decrease this if you
see memory errors.

\item \texttt{-b} or \texttt{-{}-bufsize} : The number of buffer pixels to render around the edges of the
continents. Set to zero unless the \texttt{raster-thin} option is greater than 1. The buffer
will not be very good. In general, if you want a buffer you're better off making your
own in ArcView rather than using this option.

\item \texttt{-q} or \texttt{-{}-quantiles} : A string containing the quantiles you want. For example,
\texttt{'0.25 0.5 0.75'} would map the lower and upper quartiles and the medial. Default is
\texttt{'0.05 0.25 0.5 0.75 0.95'}.

If you use \texttt{-t 10}, only every 10th stored MCMC iteration will be used to produce the maps.

Large values are good but slow. Defaults to 50000.

files' headers must match those of the input raster, and their missing pixels must match
those of the input raster also. There must be a file corresponding to every covariate column
in input 3 of mbg-infer. For example, if you used \texttt{rain} and \texttt{ndvi} as your column headers,
files \texttt{rain.asc} and \texttt{ndvi.flt} and \texttt{temp.hdf5} should be present in the raster path.
Defaults to the current working directory.

\item \texttt{-y} or \texttt{-{}-year} : If your model is spatiotemporal, you must provide the decimal year at
which you want your map produced. For example, Jan 1 2008 would be \texttt{-y 2008}.

\item \texttt{-d} or \texttt{-{}-ignore-npd} : If \texttt{1}, MCMC iterations whose covariance functions are non-
positive-definite on the data locations plus the prediction locations will be ignored. If

\item \texttt{-r} or \texttt{-{}-raster-thin}: The 3d data cube takes up much more disk space and memory than
the scalar maps. You might need to degrade the input raster to lower resolution. A value of
10 means that the 3d maps will have 1/10 the spatial resolution of the input raster. Defaults

database file. Populates this folder with files called \texttt{fname-aname-samples} and
\texttt{fname-aname-estimates}. \texttt{fname-aname-samples} is a CSV file with no column
headers whose columns correspond to reps, and whose rows correspond to Monte Carlo
trials. \texttt{fname-aname-estimates} is a CSV file whose columns have titles
\texttt{sname-estimate} and \texttt{sname-mcse}. \texttt{aname} iterates over the module's

\end{quote}

mbg-realize-prior produces a number of prior realizations of the target surface (eg parasite
rate, gene frequency, etc). on several different asciis. Joint or 'conditional' simulations
of surfaces are very expensive, so you can only afford to evaluate them on a few thousand
pixels.

The multiple asciis are meant to be at multiple resolutions: you can make a coarse one over
your entire area of interest, a medium-resolution one on a zoomed-in subset, and a few fine
ones over small areas scattered around. That way you can see the large- and small-scale
properties of the surface allowed by your prior without having to render the entire surface
at full resolution.

Outputs a number of surfaces, evaluated onto the masks indicated by the input asciis. Each set
of realizations is coherent across the input asciis; that is, the 'same' surface is evaluated
on each ascii. That means you can meaningfully overlay the output asciis at different
resolutions.

NOTE: All the parameters of the model will be drawn from the prior before generating each
realization. If you want to fix a variable, you must set its \texttt{observed} flag.
